Chinese merchants call him Happy Chinaman or Laughing Buddha.\n\nThis Hotei lived in the T\u2019ang dynasty. He had no desire to call himself a Zen master or to gather many disciples around him. Instead he walked the streets with a big sack into which he would put gifts of candy, fruit, or doughnuts. These he would give to children who gathered around him in play. He established a kindergarten of the streets.\n\nWhenever he met a Zen devotee he would extend his hand and say: \u201cGive me one penny.\u201d\n\nOnce as he was about to play-work another Zen master happened along and inquired: \u201cWhat is the significance of Zen?\u201d\n\nHotei immediately plopped his sack down on the ground in silent answer.\n\n\u201cThen,\u201d asked the other, \u201cwhat is the actualization of Zen?\u201d\n\nAt once the Happy Chinaman swung the sack over his shoulder and continued on his way."

After all, their village had all the necessities of living a comfortable life.They made an arrangement to where they would tie a person's feet, so that when he or she looked over and wished to jump, they could be pulled back.\n\nThe next time someone tried to climb the wall to see what was on the other side, they chained her feet so that she could not go over. She looked on the other side and was delighted at what she saw, and smiled.Those standing below grew curious to question her and pulled her back, but to their great disappointment she had lost the power of speech.\n\n\n\"Those who have Seen cannot say. That which has been Seen cannot be painted, cannot bereduced to words. But still each one has to give a try - and the world goes on becoming more and more beautiful because of these efforts.\""

One, that I do not wish to marry you because you are so callous and mean-spirited. And the other thing, is that I was wondering if you have it within your power to have a certain something changed.\"\n\n\"What?!\" the emperor exclaimed with outrage. \"You bitch!
